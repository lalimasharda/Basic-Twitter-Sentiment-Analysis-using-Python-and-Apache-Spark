# Basic-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Python-and-Apache-Spark

Language: Python

APIs used: Apache Spark, Apache Kafka
Real-time streaming of tweets was simulated using Spark's streaming APIs on a dataset "16M.txt.zip" containing all the tweets.
Note: To make this happen, the "twitter_to_kafka" program must be running when you run "twitterStream" program which performs the actual sentiment analysis.
